# Image-Processing-with-Python-Histogram-Equalization-and-Color-Space-Conversion
This Python code demonstrates how to perform histogram equalization and color space conversion on an image using the OpenCV library. The code reads in an image and converts it into the HSV color space. It then displays the V channel and its histogram.

The code applies histogram equalization to the V channel and displays the histogram of the result. Finally, the code uses the H and S channels from the original image and the V channel after histogram equalization to convert the image back to the RGB color space.

This code is useful for anyone interested in image processing and color space manipulation. Feel free to use and modify this code for your own purposes.
